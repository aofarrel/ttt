    "# BYOD -- Paternity Test\n",
    " \n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Generates a Terra data table from files that a user has uploaded into a workspace bucket, where each row represents a \"parent\" file and has cells for its \"children.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "It is named Paternity Test in the sense that parents and children are linked in the same table, where the parent is the file that links all the other related files together. What is determined to be a parent is set by the user specifying a file extension. For example, a CRAM file could be a parent, and its associated CRAI file could be considered its child. Another alternative is the parent could be a text file with information about the subject and the children could be multiple CRAM files from that subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "1) You have a psuedofolder in your Terra data section that contains BYOD data in the form of files -- see [here](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/BYOD-to-Terra/blob/anvil/full_documentation.md) for info on that  \n",
    "2) All of the files you want in your data table are in the same psuedofolder, and are not in sub-psuedofolders  \n",
    "3) You've uploaded all your files already -- Terra data tables are not dynamic, so if you want to add more later, you'll have to re-run this notebook  \n",
    "4) You are not trying to overwrite a data table you have already created. If you re-run this notebook and set TABLE_NAME to something that already exists as a Terra data table, the old table will NOT to overwritten. You will need to either pick a new name or delete the old table first.  \n",
    "5) Your files follow a naming convention either like this...  \n",
    "`NWD119844.CRAM`  \n",
    "`NWD119844.CRAM.CRAI`  \n",
    "...or this:  \n",
    "`NWD119844.CRAM`  \n",
    "`NWD119844.CRAI`  \n",
    "\n",
    "You do NOT have to have run File Finder before this notebook. **The difference between this notebook and File Finder is that File Finder will create a row for every file in your psuedofolder, while Paternity Test will create a row for every parent file.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Files that lack the parent file extension and are not children will NOT be added to the data table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "If you have one child per parent file, your output will look something like this.  \n",
    "\n",
    "| parent | URI        | child1 | child1 URI |  \n",
    "|--------|------------|--------|------------|  \n",

    "| cram3  | gs://cram3 | crai3  | gs://crai3 |  \n",
    "\n",
    "As more children are added, the number of rows will increase.  \n",
    "\n",
    "| parent | URI        | child1 | child1 URI | child2 | child2 URI |  \n",
    "|--------|------------|--------|------------|--------|------------|  \n",
