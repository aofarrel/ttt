    "# Introduction\n",
    "Google Cloud Storage is a great tool, but it has an odd way of handling folders. That is to say, it doesn't. There is no equivalent of `mkdir` in Google Cloud Storage. Luckily, with a few tricks, we can get around this limitation and create a psuedofolder in your workspace's data section, helping keep your BYOD files organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please be sure to read the use case below -- **this notebook is *not* needed in most BYOD cases.** It is being provided only for the few use cases it does benefit, and to shed light on how Google Cloud Storage's file system works."

    "## Use case\n",
    "If you will be using gsutil to move your files into your workspace bucket, *you do not need this notebook.* Instead, simply add the desired folder name to your gsutil cp command, such as `gsutil cp gs://source/file.cram gs://destination/desired_folder_name/file.cram`, to create the desired psuedofolder. Biodata Catalyst users who are importing data from Gen3 also have no use for this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook's rare use case is for those who cannot transfer files into a Google Bucket using gsutil for one reason or another, such as those who cannot use gsutil on their own machine and are dealing with files too large for Terra's version of gsutil to work with.** Such users might be using Terra's UI or one of the more obscure BYOD methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the only notebook in the BYOD notebook suite that is meant to be run *before* actually moving your files into your bucket. All other provided notebooks are meant to be run *after* the files are in place."

    "This explanation is only given to explain why there's no `mkdir` for GCS and why a notebook is required for what would otherwise be a simple task. It is optional reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, Google Cloud Storage does not store files in folders. Everything in your bucket is in the same directory. However, some platforms (such as Terra) want to use something like folders for organization and because a folder-based filesystem is what most people are used to working with. \n",
    "So, when Terra encounters something with this filename in Google Cloud Storage:\n",
    "`gs://fc-secure-82547374-8637-40cd-aae9-4fae154291d3/test_files/sample.txt`\n",
    "Rather than reporting the truth, ie, that a file named `test_files/sample.txt` exists in `gs://fc-secure-82547374-8637-40cd-aae9-4fae154291d3`, it shows the user a \"folder\" named `test_files` and within that \"folder\" exists `sample.txt`. So when we say `test_files` is a psuedofolder, that's what we mean. For all intents and purposes, you don't need to worry about this, as both Google Cloud Storage and Terra will \"act\" as if these are actual folders. So any scripts you have that work on a folder basis, such as the ones used in Paternity Test and other notebooks in this workspace, will work just as you expect."
