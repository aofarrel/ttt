    "This notebook was designed to form a datatable where each row represents one subject, and each cell in a given row is metadata for a certain type of TOPMed data for the row's subject. This means things get a bit awkward if your TOPMed data isn't 1-to-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, simple_germline_variation and germline_variation_index are EXCLUDED from a genotypic merge. This is because we believe study/cohort level VCFs to be more useful to researchers, and because some TOPMed studies do not have VCF/CSI for every CRAM, resulting in some empty cells in a dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data has more than one sample taken per subject, only one of those samples (and resulting CRAM files) will be put into the dataset. Consider the following situation: You have imported the following tables from TOPMed, diand see the following tables in your Data section...\n",

You will know this is going on because when running the function below, because a warning will tell you that 9 duplicate entries have been removed. These are duplicates in the sense that the subject fields are duplicates, even though the CRAMs might be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "A different mismatch can occur even before consolidating on subjects. Consider these tables:\n",

    "Not only does it look like someone got sequenced twice, there's 50 less VCF (submitted_aligned_reads) and CSI (germline_variation_index) files than there are CRAMs (submitted_aligned_reads). In this case, you will see two warnings -- first of all, you will be notified of the possibility of empty cells, because some CRAMs will not be matched to VCF and CSI files. You'll be told there is expected to be 50 empty cells. Then, you will be notified by the dropping of one of the rows, due to a subject getting sequenced twice. So, your final datatable will have 99 rows."
